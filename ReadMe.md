# üìÉ App ReadMe Plugin

### üö® Requires OctoberCMS 2.0

## ‚ú® What does this plugin do?
Provides the ability for developers to add and maintain a ReadMe section within the admin area settings panel.
Developers can add documents to the "About & Documentation" section of the admin are settings panel as long as they have "manage readmes" access.
Each document supports a title, tags (separated by comma), and sections. Each section supports a title and content section themselves. Each section supports one layer of sub-sections, which also supports a title and content section for each. All content sections support raw HTML.
When a admin/user is viewing a ReadMe with more than one section, section titles are listed at the top of the ReadMe as an index and link to the full section below.

## ‚ùì Why would I use this plugin?
Clients often ask for information about or documentation on usage of their application. Why not add it directly to the application to decrease their need to reach out to a developer or support staff? While we're at it, why not make it easy for developers to update the documentation as the application is revised?
Useful in helping clients with larger teams easily train and onboard new members.
Useful for smaller teams or those who don't often login to their applications remind themselves of how to use it.
Helpful in reminding developers how a client is using an application between development cycles.
