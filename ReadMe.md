# üìÉ App ReadMe Plugin

### üö® Requires OctoberCMS 2.0

## ‚ú® What does this plugin do?
Provides the ability for developers to add and maintain a ReadMe section within the admin area settings panel.
Developers can add "ReadMes", or documents, to the ReadMe section via the plugin settings as long as they have "manage readmes" access.
Each ReadMe supports a title, tags (separated by comma), and sections which each support a title and content section themselves. The section content supports raw HTML.
When a admin/user is viewing a ReadMe with more than one section, section titles are listed at the top of the ReadMe as an index and link to the full section below.

## ‚ùì Why would I use this plugin?
Clients often ask for information about or documentation on usage of their application. Why not add it directly to the application so it's just a click away, and make it easy for developers to update as the application is revised?
Useful in helping clients with larger teams easily train new members.
Useful for smaller teams or those who don't often login to their applications remind themselves of how to use it before contacting support.
Helpful in reminding developers how a client is using an application between development cycles.
